# TokenizerAndParser
A C program which takes a text file as input, tokenizes it, and then parses through to check if it is valid with C grammar

To compile:  gcc -std=c99 -o Analyzer.out Givens.c Parser.c Tokenizer.c Analyzer.c
To run: ./Analyzer.out

The program will then ask for a text file to tokenize and parse through, returning whether or not it is valid
